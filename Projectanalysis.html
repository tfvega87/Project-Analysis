		<h1>Site Intent</h1>
		
<a href="http://www.signsbydesign.biz/">http://www.signsbydesign.biz/</a>
	
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Signs by Design is a great website that allows any person that needs help with designing signs or lights for local businesses anywhere. They also offer repair services and have all the equipment necessary to get the job done. The website shows lots of sections with images of some samples of there work as also a way to contact them if you need them. I believe the site shows good image sample designs of their work but images and titles seem to be just everywhere wich looks bad to the eye. The navigation bar sits in the middle of the page and causes a lot of distraction on the viewers eye.  <p>


<p>My intent would be to put the images on a different page , create a better image gallery, resize the navigation bar, move paragraphs around and maybe add a little more color to the page. Reposition everything in different html pages , so each page would stand out from the other.</p>
